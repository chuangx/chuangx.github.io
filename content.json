It has evolved a lot since 2017 when google makes it as first-class language for writing android apps. It has now stable coroutines in v1.3, kotlin native in beta, multi-platform supports, etc. You can definitely see where it’s trying to move to ;) As an android developer (for about 70% time), here are the things I love about kotlin. Concise &amp; readable as a blockLet’s start demo by creating a notification channel for music playing service. Typical java version 12345678910NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(Service.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);if (notificationManager != null) &#123; NotificationChannel channel = new NotificationChannel(CHANNEL_ID, CHANNEL_NAME, NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT); channel.enableLights(true); channel.setName(\"uptown\"); channel.setDescription(\"music channel hosted by coffee-thoughts\"); channel.setLightColor(Color.GREEN); channel.setLockscreenVisibility(Notification.VISIBILITY_PUBLIC); notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel);&#125; Here is the kotlin implementation 123456789val notificationManager = getSystemService(Service.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as? NotificationManagernotificationManager?.createNotificationChannel( NotificationChannel(CHANNEL_ID, CHANNEL_NAME, NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT).apply &#123; enableLights(true) name = \"uptown\" description = \"music channel hosted by coffee-thoughts\" lightColor = Color.GREEN lockscreenVisibility = Notification.VISIBILITY_PUBLIC &#125;) The kotlin version has 1 line less of code? Hooray!Well, when I use concise as the section title here, I didn’t really mean the number of lines code though. The kotlin implementation does have less code to write, but I won’t expect to use that to convince other folks to try out a new language. (If you do get convinced by this reason, let me know, I’ll still cheer for myself 🍻) Some differences from above examples, in kotlin’s implementation set methods get replaced with kotlin generated synthetic properties scope function apply eliminates intermediate local variables as? safe type casting &amp; ?. if-not-null shorthand removes if-null checks If you know/familiar with kotlin syntax (if you’re not, leave out those syntax thing while reading), compared to java, kotlin code is much easier to read and understand, as there’re less noises and the control/execution flow is more intuitive logically. The bare-bone structure of above example is 1notificationManager.createNotification(customized_notification_channel_instance) For the kotlin implementation, you would know what the code snippet is trying to do after the first two lines of the code but not for the java one. Kotlin is able to express above flow as expected while in java implementation, the notificationManager instance and its method call of createNotification just got cut off, you could workaround it by extracting it into helper function, but it’s just not something you get out of box. Nullable &amp; its NPEIf you’re from the realm of java, you may share the same felling for the everywhere null checks and its sibling NPEs (the billion-dollar mistake). We have code review, Nullable, NonNull annotations to help, but developers usually ignore the lint warnings from IDE (it’s just a warning, what could go wrong, right?), the fact is just that people are bad at following rules, but computer does this better, so kotlin makes nullability into its type system. Think about it, String and nullable string String? are two different types #mindblowing 12345var iKnowVarIsNeverNull = \"default val\"iKnowVarIsNeverNull = null // compile errorvar expectNullableVal :String? = \"\"expectNullableVal = null // okay How this gonna change our programming mental model? Let’s continue our demo of music player by building album root by iterating media metadata. The simplified java implementation is as below, for each media metadata, it creates an album out of it and adds it to media root directory. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829/** * Builds a node, under the root, that represents an album, given * a [MediaMetadataCompat] object that's one of the songs on that album, * marking the item as [MediaItem.FLAG_BROWSABLE], since it will have child * node(s) AKA at least 1 song. */List&lt;MediaMetadataCompat&gt; buildAlbumRoot(@NonNull MediaMetadataCompat mediaMetadata) &#123; // 1. precondition check to make sure it's not null or lets hope null var is not passed in Preconditions.isNotNull(mediaMetadata); MediaMetadataCompat.Builder metaBuilder = new MediaMetadataCompat.Builder(); String albumUri = mediaMetadata.getAlbumUri(); // 2. defensive null-check (`setAblumUri` is a helper method only accepts non-null string) if (albumUri != null) &#123; metaBuilder.setAlbumUri(albumUri); &#125; final MediaMetadataCompat albumMetadata = metaBuilder.build(); // 3. create the root if it does not exist yet List&lt;MediaMetadataCompat&gt; rootList = mediaIdChildren.get(BROWSABLE_ROOT); if (rootList == null) &#123; rootList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(); &#125; rootList.add(albumMetadata); mediaIdChildren.put(BROWSABLE_ROOT, rootList); // generate &amp; return album list&#125; There’re one precondition check, two places of null-checks, from both defensive programming and inevitable list initialization (comment #3), we probably see similar code everyday if you’re coding in java. Is kotlin able to ease this pain? Here is the kotlin version implementing the same functionality 12345678910111213fun buildAlbumRoot(mediaItem: MediaMetadataCompat): MutableList&lt;MediaMetadataCompat&gt; &#123; val albumMetadata = MediaMetadataCompat.Builder().apply &#123; albumArtUri = mediaItem.albumArtUri?.toString() // other attributes settings &#125;.build() // Ensure the root node exists and add this album to the list. val rootList = mediaIdToChildren[BROWSABLE_ROOT] ?: mutableListOf() rootList += albumMetadata mediaIdToChildren[BROWSABLE_ROOT] = rootList // generate &amp; return album list&#125; In kotlin, we removed @NonNull annotation and its precondition check, we’re less paranoid about the argument nullability since we know that MediaMetadataCompat type (different from MediaMetadataCompat? remember?) is not-null by its nature, and the type system would do compile checks on it! Code flow is much less distracted when working with nullability, if-null and if-not-null get replaced by ?. and ?: syntax sugar, small thing like this really makes a huge difference on readability. Cheatsheet on working with nullability Kotlin operators Snippet elvis operator ?:, if receiver is not null use it, otherwise, use the latter return nullable_var ?: &quot;default&quot; safe call ?., execute and return var.length if not null, otherwise return null nullable_var?.length safe (nullable) cast as?, avoiding ClassCastException if cast fails nullable_var as? expected_type non-null assertion !! (also known as hold my beer operator), use the var as not-null even though it’s not from its type nullable_var!!.i_am_not_drunk() cope with scope functions (let, apply, also, etc), execute block when not null nullable_var?.let { } ExtensionsI work with iOS sometimes, among all the weirdness of objective-c, one thing I enjoy a lot is the ability to use extensions. Extension function description from kotlin site. Kotlin, similar to C# and Gosu, provides the ability to extend a class with new functionality without having to inherit from the class or use any type of design pattern such as Decorator. This is done via special declarations called extensions. Kotlin supports extension functions and extension properties. This feature is extremely useful when dealing with android, java or 3rd party sdk apis where you don’t have full control over. We’re good at creating util classes to wrap common operations on external objects, or inherit from its parent and adding more seasoning there (using inheritance with great caution). But with the help of kotlin, most of the these tasks could be done quite differently, in a happy way.If we need to convert a list of string to a list of integer, in java, We might have a ListUtil class, iterating string in the list and generate a list of integers, the method call would be like ListUtils.toIntList(string_list). With kotlin, the transform could be implemented as below 1fun List&lt;String&gt;.toIntList() = map &#123; it.toInt() &#125; and you may just call string_list.toIntList() as if toIntList() is one of List&lt;String&gt; natively supported method, the syntax is more intuitive and no extra arguments passing is needed. Above implementation also uses lambda and kotlin’s single-expression function, hopefully it’s not confusing, checkout common kotlin idioms for more info. Android supportKotlin is first-class programming language for android, the tools, libs behind it are well supported by google. Android KTX is a set of kotlin extensions that optimizes android platform apis for kotlin use, they try hard to make sure developers have a pleasant experiences ;) As an android developer, google got your back. There’re some neat kotlin+ktx examples from google developer site, go and check it out. Kotlin pandora boxAfter reading &amp; coding more with kotlin, I decide to add this section here, as a memo to myself or to anyone who might fall into this fantasy. I’ll keep a list of code idioms/snippets what I consider bad and should avoid in the future. Even though we all love conciseness, readability is always more important, do not sacrifice that when working with a language like kotlin, applying all those fancy syntax and making others lost. It’s fun to write kotlin code, however please make sure we’re writing readable &amp; maintainable code for others (and future you), code-review-with-beer is our goal ;) DO NOT abuse scope functionsSwap vars using also scope functions 1234// swap two variables, a and b hereval a = 1val b = 2a = b.also &#123; b = a &#125; Avoid java style multi-line operationsIn java, lots of people would make long single-line operations into smaller chunks by splitting it into multiple lines, this won’t work well in kotlin, as statement is line-based instead of comma based in kotlin, this is something we need to be aware of. Let’s run through examples below 123456789101112131415// multi-line operations are not the same in java// below two values are actually differentval testVal = 1 + 2 // 3 - expected// Bad / Wrong - the second line would just be ignored and no lint warnings generatedval multiLineVal = 1 + 2 // multilLineVal is evaluated as 1// But if you lift the operator up to the first line, it would produce 3, hmmm..val multiLineVal = 1 + 2 // multiLineVal is 3// Or wrapping the statement in ()val multiLineVal = (1 + 2) // produce 3 As it is way too easy to make mistakes, I would simply recommend to avoid this type of style until we have better IDE supports in the future. I’m so glad and you read till here, if you ever feel tired of coding java but still love the ecosystem, try out kotlin (kotlin is 100% interoperable with java and it’s way beyond that), it might be a good fit for you. There’re lots of other syntax sugar and language features I’m not covering here, such as data class, string interpolation, lazy properties, delegation, coroutines, etc. The official kotlin reference has always been helpful to me, start from there if you want to explore more. #Happy coding","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"kotlin","slug":"kotlin","permalink":"https://github.com/chuangx/tags/kotlin/"}]},{"title":"IPC in Android","slug":"IPC-in-Android","date":"2019-03-01T11:32:04.000Z","updated":"2019-05-08T09:32:58.349Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/01/IPC-in-Android/","link":"","permalink":"https://github.com/chuangx/2019/03/01/IPC-in-Android/","excerpt":"What IPC (inter-process communication) mechanisms are commonly used in android, and how does it work under the hood?

But IPC actually runs everywhere from app starts to any interactions to system or third party apps, so how the magic works? Well, first all, let’s warm up a bit, what IPC mechanisms are supported by linux? We have signals, pipes, sockets, message queues, semaphores and shared memory, etc. On android, the underlying mechanisms are still the same, but it’s presented quite differently to developers, let’s quickly run through tasks below Share text through system action sheet - startActivity(Intent.createChooser(intent_data)) Start a foreground service to play music - startService(Intent(this, MusicService::class.java)) Retrieve contacts from phone app by using content provider Send &amp; handle broadcast event Above scenarios cover the 4 fundamental components in android. For the first one, when we make startActivity call to share content through intent to another app, how is the data being passed around? Apps are running in its separate processes, so IPC is clearly involved in this (same applies to the rest 3 examples above), let’t dive into this.

Loaders have been deprecated as of Android P (API 28). The recommended option for dealing with loading data while handling the Activity and Fragment lifecycles is to use a combination of ViewModels and LiveData. ViewModels survive configuration changes like Loaders but with less boilerplate. LiveData provides a lifecycle-aware way of loading data that you can reuse in multiple ViewModels.If you’ve never used loader before, congrats, time to go with architecture component directly! Service在后台任务处理中又扮演了怎样的一个角色呢？Service设计之初就是为了可以在后台执行long-running operations, 一个常见的误解就是Service就是运行在background thread上的，我想其中一大原因就是来自Service的定义，background + long-running operations很容易给人有错误的假定。 A Service is an application component that can perform long-running operations in the background, and it doesn’t provide a user interface. Service默认运行在当前应用进程的主线中，所以如果需要执行blocking or intensive work (different from long-running operations)，我们还是需要自己创建新的进程。为了方便开发，Android实现了IntentService，它通过一个后台线程去处理所有的任务请求，需要注意的是任务的处理是串行的。那么IntentService或是通过Service实现的其它后台任务处理和AsyncTask或是Thread的区别是什么呢？虽然它们本质上都是对Thread的封装，但是它们有完全不同的设计初衷。对于AsyncTask而言，更多的和Activity/UI关联，而且任务处理通常是要求很短，而Service更多的是在应用处于后台（没有用户交互或是UI更新）时发挥作用，而且在任务没有完成之前，Service可以要求在系统资源充足时重启。JobIntentService又是怎么一回事？ 这些缘起于Android对后台任务的限制和优化。我们之后在后台一直运行Service其实很吃系统资源，特别是有不少无良App会通过Service常驻后台，给用户带来了很差的用户体验。所以Android N（Android 7.0）和 Android O（Android 8.0）系统对Background Service和Broadcast做了一定的限制，其中的一些限制包括：不可以在应用处于后台状态时call startService启动Service，IllegalStateException will be thrown otherwise当应用退到后台之后，系统会给应用几分钟左右的时间继续运行之前所创建启动的后台服务，之后便会被系统标记为空闲状态，并停止该后台服务。 Above limitations are only background service as foreground service is more visible to users. 对于Broadcast的限制包括： Android 7.0 中，app can NOT send or receive ACTION_NEW_PICTURE or ACTION_NEW_VIDEO broadcast App targeting Android 7.0 and higher can’t receive CONNECTIVITY_ACTION if it’s declared in manifest From Android O，all implicit broadcast receivers declared in manifest file will not work 这么做的原因很简单，因为implicit broadcast是一个很浪费系统资源的事情。比如有10个应用注册并监听了这个CONNECTIVITY_ACTION这个广播，当用户手机的网络连接发生变化时，这10个应用都会被唤起去处理这个事件，但可能其中90%的应用只关心用户是否连接到wifi以便同步数据，那么当用户失去网络连接或是连接到metered network时，这些应用都被不必要的唤醒了。为了解决这些问题，并给开发者提供更加智能的后台任务处理，Android提出了Job和JobScheduler的概念，在下一篇文章中我们将会有进一步的了解。 上一篇文章中我们大致讲解了AsyncTask, Loader, IntentService的区别以及API的演变发展，为了优化后台任务，给开发者提供更加方便智能的任务处理，Android在5.0 (API 21)中推出了JobScheduler。JobScheduler的一大优点就是它是基于条件而非时间而进行任务处理的。 [ref https://medium.com/google-developers/scheduling-jobs-like-a-pro-with-jobscheduler-286ef8510129] (这篇文章讲的很棒）。JobScheduler performs work based on conditions, not on time.通过JobInfo我们可以很容易得配置后台任务所需的各种条件 ，比如网络类型，系统是否空闲， 是否在充电等等，在Android 8.0 (API 26)中，我们还可以设置电量和存储容量的限制。 12345678val jobScheduler = context.getSystemService(Context.JOB_SCHEDULER_SERVICE) as JobScheduler jobScheduler.schedule(JobInfo.Builder(JOB_ID, ComponentName(context, CustomJobService::class.java)) .setRequiredNetworkType(JobInfo.NETWORK_TYPE_UNMETERED) // 连接wifi时 .setRequiresDeviceIdle(true) // 需要系统空闲 .setRequiresCharging(true) // 设备充电中 .setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true) // requires API 26 电量 .setRequiresStorageNotLow(true) // requires API 26 存储容量 .build()) JobSchduler通过在系统级别实现所有应用后台任务的统一调度，这样我们就不用通过AlarmManager不断唤起应用去检查并执行任务了，极大程度上缓解了电量的损耗。我们所需要执行的任务通过JobService来实现，JobService是一个bound service，只不过它实现在自己的IBinder以便JobScheduler进行通信。我们只需要实现如下两个方法就可以了。 1234567891011121314151617/** * 我们需要在这个方法回调中开始任务。 * 和其它Service一样，默认在主线程执行，所以任何可能阻塞UI的操作都应该通过worker thread去执行。 * * @param params 关于当前job的一些信息 * @return true 如果当前job还需要执行一段时间（比如开启了新的线程）, 反之return false */abstract fun onStartJob(params: JobParameters): Boolean/** * 因为JobService是基于条件调度的，所以当所需的条件不再满足时，系统便会通过这个回调通知我们，我们需要 * 在这个方法中停止正在执行的任务并完成相应的中断处理。 * * @param params 关于当前job的一些信息, 比如job id，任务停止原因等等 * @return true 如果当前中断的任务需要被重新调度，反之return false */abstract fun onStopJob(params: JobParameters): Boolean 所以在Android L+ (5.0+ API 21+)后，所有复杂，周期性的后台任务我们都可以通过JobScheduler来实现以达到更好的性能。WARNING - JobScheduler在API 21和22中有很多bug，所以如果我们在production中，最好在API 23+之后才使用JobScheduler。讲到这，另一个我们需要了解的部件就是JobDispatcher，它的存在就是为了实现JobScheduler的向后兼容 (最低支持 API 14)。JobDispatcher来自于Firebase，它设计了和JobScheduler类似的API，在Android L+的系统中，底层的实现就是JobScheduler。在Android L之前的系统中，它通过使用Google Play Service来充当统一调度者的角色，这也就意味着需要设备安装GMS才可以，对于国内的用户来说，我们也就只需要了解一下就好了，反之也不大用得上 :(WorkManager 是今年IO推出的新的API，最简单的概括就是它是对我们之前提到的JobScheduler, JobDispatcher, AlarmManager的另一层封装，它会根据不同系统选择合适的实现方式。当然它还给我们提供一些其它的功能，比如更加灵活的任务调度chain jobs，i.e. WorkManager.getInstance().beginWith(A, B).then(C).then(D).enqueue()。 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233static @NonNull Scheduler createBestAvailableBackgroundScheduler(@NonNull Context context) &#123; Scheduler scheduler; boolean enableFirebaseJobService = false; boolean enableSystemAlarmService = false; if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= WorkManagerImpl.MIN_JOB_SCHEDULER_API_LEVEL) &#123; scheduler = new SystemJobScheduler(context);

&#125; catch (ClassNotFoundException e) &#123; // Do nothing. &#125; setComponentEnabled(context, SystemAlarmService.class, enableSystemAlarmService); return scheduler;&#125; Scheduler是用来调度工作的interface，从👆的代码段中我们可以看到WorkManager是如果根据系统条件创建Scheduler的，简易的决策图如下 需要注意的是WorkManager和Service一样，是用来实现那些即便应用被杀死之后仍需完成的任务。对于那些前台的耗时任务，我们需要通过AnsycTask，ThreadPool来实现，详情可以阅读前一篇文章。希望这两篇文章能够给大家对android后台任务的API演变有一个大致的了解，并学会根据项目要求选择最合适的实现。 happy coding","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"android","slug":"android","permalink":"https://github.com/chuangx/tags/android/"}]},{"title":"Backstack and task management for picture-in-picture on android O","slug":"Picture-in-picture-on-Android-O","date":"2018-03-26T08:05:46.000Z","updated":"2019-05-08T08:08:28.573Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/26/Picture-in-picture-on-Android-O/","link":"","permalink":"https://github.com/chuangx/2018/03/26/Picture-in-picture-on-Android-O/","excerpt":"","text":"This article was first published on medium in ProAndroidDev.
